The goal of this project was to sort numbers using two stacks with only 11 operations to operate stacks.

| instructions  | Description   |
|:-------------:|---------------|
| sa            | swap first two elements of stack A |
| sb            | swap first two elements of stack B |
| ss            | sa and sb at the same time |
| pa            | pops the first elememt on B and puts it on top of A |
| pb            | pops the first elememt on A and puts it on top of B |
| ra            | rotates stuck A up by one|
| rb            | rotates stuck B up by one |
| rr            | rotates both A and B up by one |
| rra           | rotates stuck A down by one |
| rrb           | rotates stuck B down by one |
| rrr           | rotates both A and B down by one |

Restrictions: 
1. no more than 2-3 operations for 3 integers
2. no more than 12 operations for 5 integers
3. no more than 700 operations for 100 integers
4. no more than 5300 operations for 500 integers
